Things I'd like to accomplish in the next twenty minutes: 
Roughly figure out what I'm going to say at the presentation today! ✔

Current Status Slide:
- Shortly go over what our main goals are for the front-end (Ethan will cover the back-end)

Demo Slide:
Quickly go over the front-end fragments that exist so far, incoming/outgoing section, map, 
part that uses the database!!

Successes, Roadblocks, & Changes Slide:
Successes: Integrating the database.
Roadblocks: No real roadblocks, just unexpected challenges... took nearly three times as long as we had originally scheduled time for. 
Changes: We originally had the idea of using Flutter, which is a software that would allow us
to program an app for iOS and Android at the same time, but we decided that due to time constraints
it would be best to just work on Android and leave iOS open as an opportunity for next year's Senior Design Groups.
