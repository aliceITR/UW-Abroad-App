### Project summary
The objective of this project is to provide the University of Wyoming Study Abroad Office with a mobile application to help students with all stages of participation in education abroad. We hope to deliver an application that can be a central source of resources for those considering applying, already abroad, re-entering, as well as, incoming foreign students. A single application that can offer support to students will benefit the students so that they are able to find information they need and stay connected to both UW and their abroad location with ease. Participating in the University of Wyomingâ€™s education abroad can be a fulfilling experience, but also intimidating so we hope to produce an application which will help guide the student through all stages of the process. 

### Major tasks and plans
1.	User interface
The application will have resources for students through all stages of going abroad. We want to ensure the application is well organized so it can be easily navigated, and the student can find the information that is most pertinent and helpful to them. We will have different tabs in the application, one for those deciding whether to go abroad, one for those who are preparing to go abroad, one for those who are currently abroad, another for who are returning from being abroad, and lastly, a tab for those who are coming to UW for their abroad experience.
  1.1	Deciding
    *	A list of all available programs and universities with possible filtering by type (study abroad or exchange), location, classes offered, term, etc.
    *	Quiz that ask questions about what ideas the student has in what they are looking for and suggests programs that match what they need
    *	Resources on financial aid, scholarships and cost considerations
    *	Posts from
  1.2	Preparing
    * A list of what is needed to be completed for the chosen school
    *	Notifications for upcoming deadlines
    *	Contact information for those that have already studied there
    *	Information on what to expect
  1.3.	Studying
    *	Notifications for UW deadlines, such as, advising or course registration
    *	Details on course information that should be saved to help with credit transfer
  1.4.	Returning
    *	Notifications for reconnecting events
    *	Information on submitting credits to be transferred
  1.5	Incoming
    *	Information on Laramie
    *	A list of campus clubs and events
    *	Opt-in list of contact information for other incoming students to connect with
    *	Orientation on campus
2.	Database
Synchronizing data and offline features will be essential to the success of the application. Because there will be updates and edits to the application, the database will need to flexible. The application will be supported by both Android and iOS, as well as, a website that will administer any changes which will need to be considered.
3.	Editing and updating 
As more information comes to the study abroad office, we want to allow the advisors and other administrators to continue to edit the information so that the students are given the most up to date information. Updating will likely take place at the end of each term so that posts can be made about the most recent student experiences. Editing the application will be done from a website that can connect to the database to add to it and upload the information to the application. This website will require its own user interface and secure administrator sign in.
4.	Security
Protecting the information of the students and administrative rights will be fundamental. To access the application, the user will be required to log in. Ideally, the sign in would be the same UW credentials used by all students and faculty, however, for the scope of this project coordinating with the UW IT department may be too difficult. Instead, we will ask the students to sign in with another account to access the application and create individual administer accounts for those within the study abroad office who will be editing.
### Tools to be used
*	Flutter
  Uses the Dart language, can be used to develop both Android and iOS applications simultaneously
*	Azure Web App Service
 	Will require funding which may be available from the Honors program, the university, or 	cybersecurity
*	OAuth
  Can be used for signing into app with Google account
### Member Roles
Formal member roles have yet to be decided, we all have a variety of experience and what we believe are our strengths. We are all willing to step up to  contribute to the sucess of the project.
